Hello and welcome to my bio!
About Me.

My name is Ryan Symes and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.

Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and Sketch. 

I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.
