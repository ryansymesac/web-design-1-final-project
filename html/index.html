        <p>My name is Ryan Symes and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.

            Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience with
            a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and
            Sketch.

            I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to experiment
            with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.

                    <h2>Logo Creation</h2>
                    <p> Your logo is the face of your brand and the first thing that potential customers will see, so
                        it's
                        crucial to make a great first impression. I can help create a logo that is both visually
                        stunning
                        and effective in representing your brand.

                        to
                        make a strong first impression. I can help you create a website that not only looks great but
                        also
                        functions flawlessly and engages your target audience.

                    <p>Your brand is much more than just a logo or a website. It's the overall image that your business
                        presents to the world, including the look, feel, and voice of your brand. I can help you create
                        a cohesive and impactful brand that resonates with your target audience and sets you apart from
                        your competitors.
