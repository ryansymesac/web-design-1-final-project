        <p>My name is Ryan Symes and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.

            Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience with
            a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and
            Sketch.

            I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to experiment
            with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.

                        crucial to make a great first impression. I can help create a logo that is both visually
                        stunning
                        and effective in representing your brand.

                        to
                        make a strong first impression. I can help you create a website that not only looks great but
